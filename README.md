### Xposed module for android 4.x that makes the call picture full screen

I liked the Full Screen Call Picture option present in the [GravityBox](http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/app-gravitybox-v3-1-4-tweak-box-android-t2316070) Xposed Module but I didn't need any of the other things so I extracted only that feature and made it a standalone module.  
I did it because I didn't find it as a standalone anywhere else. It's no new thing but I thought of sharing this just in case others might find it useful.

So big thanks to [C3C076](http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=5008415) for sharing the source code of his application and hopefully some of you will enjoy this.
